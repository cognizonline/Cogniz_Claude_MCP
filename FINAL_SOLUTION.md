# Final Solution - Cogniz MCP Server

## Why Per-User Auth Doesn't Work Yet

After extensive implementation and testing, here's what we learned:

### The Problem

**ChatGPT's Security:**
- ‚ùå Won't accept API keys as tool parameters (by design)
- ‚ùå "I can't take or store API keys ‚Äî even temporarily"
- ‚úÖ Correct security behavior!

**Claude/MCP Limitations:**
- OAuth Client Secret field expects full OAuth server (authorization endpoints, token endpoints)
- Bearer token support exists but no UI field for custom tokens
- Configuration tools don't work for sensitive credentials

### What We Tried

1. ‚úÖ **OAuth discovery endpoints** - Implemented but not enough
2. ‚úÖ **Bearer token extraction** - Works but no way for users to provide it
3. ‚ùå **Configuration tool** - ChatGPT correctly refuses to handle API keys
4. ‚ùå **Session-based auth** - Same security issue

## Current Solution: One Deployment Per User

### Architecture

```
User's Cogniz Account ‚Üí User's MCP Deployment ‚Üí Claude/ChatGPT
   (API Key)              (Environment Variable)      (Connects)
```

Each user deploys their own MCP server instance with their API key.

### For Users

**Step 1: Get Your API Key**
- Go to https://cogniz.online
- Settings ‚Üí API Keys
- Copy your key: `mp_1_xxxxxxxxxxxxx`

**Step 2: Deploy Your Own Instance**

**Option A: Render.com (Easiest)**

1. Fork: https://github.com/cognizonline/Cogniz_Claude_MCP
2. Sign up at render.com
3. Create "Web Service"
4. Connect your forked repo
5. Settings:
   - Build: `npm install && npm run build`
   - Start: `npm run start:remote`
6. Environment Variables:
   ```
   COGNIZ_API_KEY = mp_1_your_key_here
   COGNIZ_BASE_URL = https://cogniz.online
   ```
7. Deploy
8. Get your URL: `https://your-service.onrender.com/mcp`

**Option B: Deploy Anywhere**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cognizonline/Cogniz_Claude_MCP
cd cogniz-mcp-server
npm install
npm run build

export COGNIZ_API_KEY=mp_1_your_key
npm run start:remote
```

**Step 3: Connect to Claude/ChatGPT**
- Add connector with YOUR server URL
- No OAuth, no API key fields needed
- Your server uses your API key from environment

### For Server Owner (You)

**Current Public Server:**
- URL: `https://cogniz-claude-mcp.onrender.com/mcp`
- Uses YOUR API key from Render environment
- Everyone shares YOUR account
- **Use case:** Demo/testing only

**Recommendation:**
- Keep public server for demos
- Tell users to deploy their own for production
- Document clearly: "Shared demo - deploy your own for privacy"

## Why This Is The Right Solution

### Security ‚úÖ
- API keys never exposed to AI assistants
- Each user's key stays in their deployment
- No credential passing through tools

### Privacy ‚úÖ
- Each user has isolated deployment
- No shared accounts
- Complete data isolation

### Simplicity ‚úÖ
- One-time deployment
- No complex OAuth flows
- Works with all MCP clients

## Future: When Platform Support Arrives

When Claude/ChatGPT add support for:
- Custom authentication headers
- Or API key configuration fields (not OAuth)
- Or secure credential storage for MCP

Then we can enable per-user auth on a shared server.

**The code is ready!** The Bearer token extraction logic exists. We just need platform support.

## What Each File Does

**`server-remote.ts`**
- Main MCP server
- Uses `COGNIZ_API_KEY` from environment
- All users of this deployment share that account

**`USER_AUTHENTICATION.md`**
- Documents the attempted per-user auth
- Explains why it doesn't work yet
- Shows code is ready for future

**`DEPLOYMENT_NOTES.md`**
- Explains deployment options
- Security considerations
- Platform limitations

**`QUICK_USER_SETUP.md`**
- 5-minute guide for deploying own instance

## Recommended Documentation For Users

Add this to your Cogniz platform:

---

**Using Cogniz with Claude/ChatGPT (MCP)**

**Demo (Shared Account):**
- URL: `https://cogniz-claude-mcp.onrender.com/mcp`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Shares one account - for testing only
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Do not store sensitive data

**Your Own Instance (Private):**
1. Get API key from Settings
2. Deploy to Render (5 minutes)
3. Use your server URL
4. Access only your memories

**Deploy Guide:** https://github.com/cognizonline/Cogniz_Claude_MCP

## Summary

| Approach | Status | Use Case |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Shared server with environment key | ‚úÖ Working | Demo/testing |
| Per-user auth via tool | ‚ùå Security issue | Not viable |
| Per-user auth via OAuth fields | ‚ùå Platform limitation | Not viable yet |
| Deploy per user | ‚úÖ **Recommended** | Production |

**For now:** One deployment per user is the secure, privacy-preserving solution.

**Future:** When platforms add auth support, we can migrate to shared server with per-user credentials.

The code is ready. We're waiting for platform capabilities! üöÄ
